# Udacity / Grow with Google Front-end Nanodegree Capstone

Project 7 in the Udacity / Grow with Google Front-End Nanodegree program presents an interactive Neighborhood Map assignment utilizing JavaScript, React and third-party APIs ( in this case Google Maps and Foursquare).

This is a "simple" one page website that is anytihng but simple to create. I spent many hours--and days--learning the ins-and-outs of React and all of the necessary semantics. I read, viewed examples, and created this project using several different approaches; from a basically JavaScript build that made some use of React, to this product that makes intensive use of React.

Much of this product follows closely the example detailed by Forrest Walker in his YouTube walkthrough(s). I learned much about props and params by watching and building the project several ways. The simplest of all the methods I explored was the mostly JS version, but it did not meet the project rubric to use props.

## Running the Project

Either clone or download the repo file. You will need to have React installed in the directory; this project was created with _Create React App_ (https://gitjub.com/facebook/create-reat-app). Running the map project in developer mode is done with the command "npm start" in the directory's terminal window. Thsi will start the development server and open your browser. If the browser doesn't open you can manually navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

## Building (Publishing) the Project

In order to utilize the service worker OFFLINE FUNCTIONALITY of this project it is necessary to make a production build. This can be done with the command "npm build" in the directory's terminal window. If you wish to make a production build of the project follow the directions at (https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment). In order to host the pages on GitHub please review and follow the instructions for gh-pages on the aforementioned docs.
